# jazz-engine

Prolog implementation of music theory &amp; jazz guitar.


## Usage

### Notes

The `note` record is defined as:

```prolog
record note(name:atom, accidental:atom=natural, octave:integer=4).
```

Use the `mk_note(Name, Note)`, `mk_note(Name, Accidental, Note)`, or `mk_note(Name, Accidental, Octave, Note)`
to create a new note variable. Alternatively, you can use the literal syntax:

```prolog
note{name: c, accidental: natural, octave: 4}
```

Pretty print a list of notes using `pretty_print/1`.

#### Sharps and Flats

The `sharp/2` predicate raises a note by a semitone. The `flat/2` predicate behaves in a similar way.

To normalize a note from potential flat to sharp/natural only, use `sharpify_flats/2`.

#### Enharmonics

Two notes are enharmonic if they share the same pitch. The predicate `enharmonic/2` captures this.

### Intervals

The `interval/3` predicate is defined as:

```prolog
interval(First, Second, Semitones) :- ...
```

It uses a lookup table of all notes (in sharpified form) to compute the distance between the indices of the given notes. 

Interval names are available using the `interval_name/2` predicate. 

**Example: Using `interval/3` to find the distance between notes**

Query:
```
?- mk_note(c, natural, 4, C4), 
   mk_note(e, flat, 4, E_flat), 
   interval(C4, E_flat, Semitones), 
   interval_name(Semitones, IntervalName).
```
Output:
```
C4 = note{accidental:natural, name:c, octave:4},
E_flat = note{accidental:flat, name:e, octave:4},
Semitones = 3,
IntervalName = minor_third.
```

**Example: Using `interval/3` to find the note a given distance away**

Query:
```
?- mk_note(c, Root), interval_name(Semitones, minor_third), interval(Root, SecondNote, Semitones).
```
Output:
```
Root = note{accidental:natural, name:c, octave:4},
Semitones = 3,
SecondNote = note{accidental:sharp, name:d, octave:4}.
```

### Scales

There are two important concepts in scales. 

A *pattern* is the set of intervals that makes up the scale.
For example, a major scale has the pattern "whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half",
or-- expressed as semitones above the tonic, `[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]`.
This pattern is available as `major_scale_pattern/1`. There is also `minor_scale_pattern/1`.

A *scale degree* is an array index into a scale. The Nth scale degree in a given key is the Nth note of that scale. 
The `scale_degree/4` predicate works like this:

```prolog
scale_degree(Tonic, Pattern, Degree, Note) :-
    nth1(Degree, Pattern, Interval),
    interval(Tonic, Note, Interval).
```

The shortcut `major_scale_degree/3` is also provided, eliminating the `Pattern` argument.

The `scale/3` primitive generates degrees 1 through 7 in a given pattern, starting with a given tonic:

```prolog
scale(Tonic, Pattern, Notes) :-  % generates list of intervals above tonic, by scale degree
    betweenToList(1,7,Degrees),
    maplist(\Degree^Note^(
        scale_degree(Tonic, Pattern, Degree, Note)
    ), Degrees, Notes).
```

The shortcuts `major_scale/2` and `minor_scale/2` are also provided, eliminating the `Pattern` argument.

**Example: Generating a D major scale:**

Query:
```
?- mk_note(d, Tonic), major_scale(Tonic, Notes), pretty_print(Notes).
```

Output (manually formatted for readability; `pretty_print` result is the first line):
```
d_natural_4 e_natural_4 f_sharp_4 g_natural_4 a_natural_5 b_natural_5 c_sharp_5 
Tonic = note{accidental:natural, name:d, octave:4},
Notes = [
   note{accidental:natural, name:d, octave:4}, 
   note{accidental:natural, name:e, octave:4}, 
   note{accidental:sharp, name:f, octave:4}, 
   note{accidental:natural, name:g, octave:4}, 
   note{accidental:natural, name:a, octave:5}, 
   note{accidental:natural, name:b, octave:5}, 
   note{accidental:sharp, name:c, octave:5}
].
```

### Chords

The `chord` record type is defined as:

```prolog
:- record chord(root:note, pattern:list, degrees:list, adjustments:list).
```

`degrees` represents a list of scale degrees making up the chord, *starting from the givn `root` note of the chord as `1`*.

The `pattern` and `adjustments` arguments can be combined in flexible ways to produce different chords. 
The scale `degrees` making up the chord will be mapped onto the provided `pattern`,
so using a minor pattern with no `adjustments` will yield a minor chord. 
The `adjustments` are applied after this, and can be used to reference tones outside the key. 
For example, to represent a diminished chord, we would request scale degrees `[1, 3, 5]`, a minor pattern,
and the adjustments `[natural, natural, flat]`. This will yield a tonic (1), a minor third (m3) from the pattern, 
and a diminished fifth (b5) from the `flat` adjustment applied on the top note.

This is a very flexible system, for example it is possible to create a minor chord at least two ways:

```
chord{root: _, pattern: <minor pattern>, degrees: [1, 3, 5], adjustments: [natural, natural, natural]}
chord{root: _, pattern: <major pattern>, degrees: [1, 3, 5], adjustments: [natural, flat, natural]}
```

#### Available Chord Shortcuts:

- `major_chord/3`
- `minor_chord/3`
- `diminished_chord/3`
- `augmented_chord/3`
- `major_minor_major_7_chord/3`
- `sus2_chord/3`
- `sus4_chord/3`
- `nine_sus4_chord/3`

### Chord Notes

The `chord_notes/2` primitive converts between a chord and a set of notes.

**Example: Building a chord with `major_chord/2` and getting the notes with `chord_notes/2`:**

Query:
```
?- mk_note(c, Root), major_chord(C, Chord), chord_notes(Chord, Notes), pretty_print(Notes).
```

Output (manually formatted for readability) -- the `pretty_print` is the first line:
```
c_natural_4 e_natural_4 g_natural_4 
Root = note{accidental:natural, name:c, octave:4},
Chord = chord{adjustments:[natural, natural, natural], 
              degrees:[1, 3, 5], 
              pattern:[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11], 
              root:note{accidental:natural, name:c, octave:4}},
Notes = [note{accidental:natural, name:c, octave:4}, 
         note{accidental:natural, name:e, octave:4}, 
         note{accidental:natural, name:g, octave:4}] .
```


### Chord Progressions

The `chord_progression/4` predicate has the signature:

```prolog
chord_progression(Tonic, Pattern, Degrees, Chords)
```

**Example: Creating a I-vi-ii-V chord progression in G:**

Query:
```
?- mk_note(g, Tonic), major_scale_pattern(Pattern), chord_progression(Tonic, Pattern, [1, 6, 2, 5], Chords).
```

Output (manually formatted for readability):
```
Tonic = note{accidental:natural, name:g, octave:4},
Pattern = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11],
Chords = [
   chord{adjustments:[natural, natural, natural], 
         degrees:[1, 3, 5], 
         pattern:[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11], 
         root:note{accidental:natural, name:g, 
         octave:4}}, 
   chord{adjustments:[natural, natural, natural], 
         degrees:[1, 3, 5], 
         pattern:[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9|...], 
         root:note{accidental:natural, name:e, 
         octave:5}}, 
   chord{adjustments:[natural, natural, natural], 
         degrees:[1, 3, 5], 
         pattern:[0, 2, 4, 5, 7|...], 
         root:note{accidental:natural, 
         name:a, 
         octave:5}}, 
   chord{adjustments:[natural, natural, natural], 
         degrees:[1, 3, 5], 
         pattern:[0, 2, 4, 5|...], 
         root:note{accidental:natural, 
         name:d, 
         octave:5}}
].
```

### The Angry Man

<img src="https://stevedukes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pict4.jpeg" />

Composition by Steve Dukes, whose rules are implemented here.

Predicates can be found in `angry_man.pl`.

#### 12-Tone Rows

A Tone Row is a permutation of the 12 basic notes, with unbound octave values:

```prolog
tone_row_mk_12_unbound_notes(Notes) :-
    Notes = [
        note{name: a, accidental: natural, octave: _},
        note{name: a, accidental: sharp, octave: _},
        ...
    ].


tone_row(Notes) :-
    tone_row_mk_12_unbound_notes(TwelveUnboundNotes),
    permutation(TwelveUnboundNotes, PermutedNotes),
    Notes = PermutedNotes.
```

The provided helper predicate `unique_tones/1` holds if the tones within a given list of notes
are unique (ignoring octave).

The Angry Man intervals are:

```prolog
angry_man_interval_names([
    minor_second,
    major_second,
    tritone,
    minor_seventh,
    major_seventh
]).
```

These are available as semitone counts in `angry_man_intervals/1`.

The predicate `angry_man_next_note/2` accepts a list and a note.
This predicate holds if the given note "fits" as a next note in an Angry Man tone row.

A note fits if it is either the first note in the row,
or it is a second note and it is one of the above intervals away from the first note,
or if it is a new (unique) tone and forms an Angry Man interval with the previous note.

The `angry_man_row/1` predicate is intended to *verify* if a tone row is a valid Angry Man row.
An experimental implementation `exp_angry_man_row/1` may be much more efficient. 

The predicate `the_angry_man/2` (variables are `ToneRows` and `Length`) is supposed to
generate all tone rows satisfying the constraints of the composition.

<bold>
Some of The Angry Man predicates do not work as expected for rows longer than 5 notes.
This is a known issue and work-in-progress.
</bold>

#### The Angry Man: Analysis

Let's dive into the numbers.

The number of permutations without repetition $_nP_r$ read as "$n$ options pick $r$" is given by the formula:

$$
\text{\# possible permutations} 
= {_nP_r} 
= \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

In our case, there are 45 notes on the Martin DC-45. 
Each tone row has 12 tones.
So, the number of possible 12-tone rows on the guitar is given by

$$
\begin{align*}

\text{\# possible 12-tone rows} 
= {_{45}P_{12}} 
&= \frac{45!}{(45-12)!}
&\approx 1.377 Ã— 10^{19}

\end{align*}
$$

This is around 13 quintillion, or 13 billion billion possible combinations.

However, in this composition, there are more constraints.
Let's work backwards to the definition of a permutation in order to more
      easily introduce these constraints to the equation
      without having to deal with factorials.

Given a set of notes $E$ already in the tone row,
      let the set $N$ represent the possible next notes.

An upper bound for the number of options $|N|$ 
      is given by the number of remaining available tones.
Since each tone is only used once,
      at each decision point there are at most $45 - |E|$ choices remaining.

Following this logic we can re-write the permutations formula as

$$
{_nP_r} = 
\prod
      _{i = 0}^{r - 1}
      (n - i)
$$

In our case, it yields the same result:

$$
\begin{align*}

{_{45}P_{12}} 
= \prod
      _{i = 0}^{11}
      (45 - i)
\approx 1.377 Ã— 10^{19}

\end{align*}
$$

There are 5 vaild intervals between each note in The Angry Man's tone rows.

At each step, an option is invalid if there is already a note
      with the same tone (note name and accidental, don't care about octave).

Let's estimate this as the number of notes already in the row,
      multiplied by the expected probability that a given note will
      fall one of the accepted intervals away from a given note.

From any given note, there are 5 options up and 5 options down.
      For each option (which is a tone), 
      there are about $45/12 = 3.75$ octaves in which it could fall,
      meaning each note really has about 
      $(5 + 5) * 3.75 \approx 37$ valid options for a next note.
So, the probability of a given note being a valid interval away from another
      note is about $37/45 \approx 82.2\%$.

Assuming an even distribution of tones in the guitar's range, 
      the number of choices $|N|$ at each stage 
      (given the existing row $E$) 
      is now estimated by the following equation:

$$
|N| \approx

\left[

45
- 
\underbrace{|E| * \frac{45}{12}}_{\text{Already used}}
~
\right]
*
\underbrace{\frac{(5 + 5) * 3.75}{45}}_{\text{Expected \% with valid interval}}

$$

In the case of our tone rows, $|E|$ is given by the iteration variable
      $i$ at each step. 

Simplifying yields the following estimate for the total number
      of possible Angry Man tone rows:

$$
\text{\# possible Angry Man rows}
= \prod
      _{i = 0}
      ^{11}
      \left(45 - i * \frac{45}{12}\right)
      *
      (83.\bar3\%)
\approx

4.15468 Ã— 10^{14}
$$

This gives us about 415 trillion (or 415 million million) possible Angry Man tone rows.

That number is still based on a big hidden assumption:
      the probability of picking a valid (right interval away) note 
      out of the possible options remains constant as the tone row
      grows.
In other words, it's possible that as we pick more notes,
      it becomes either harder or easier to find notes that are a valid
      interval away. This *likely* depends on which notes we pick.

#### Example Angry Man Tone Row Generation

Users can repeatedly call `angry_man_next_note/2` to build an Angry Man tone row
incrementally, choosing each note from a list of possible options.

As the tone row grows, the number of options grows and shrinks non-linearly.
This matches the expectation above-- each note will have its own size of 
future possibility space, probably not linearly related to the already chosen notes.
